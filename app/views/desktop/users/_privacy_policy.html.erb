        <div class="pri-hd">Do we use 'cookies'?</div>

        <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive
          through
          your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your
          browser
          and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the
          items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or
          current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us
          compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences
          and
          tools in the future.</p>

          all
          cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little
          different,
          so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>

        <div class="pri-hd">Google</div>

        <p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place
          to
          provide a positive experience for
          users.<a class="breakall" href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en">https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en</a>
          We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</p>

        <p>Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie
          enables
          it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt

          of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.</p>

        <div class="pri-hd">California Online Privacy Protection Act</div>

        <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
          privacy
          policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States
          (and
          conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California
          consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected
          and
          those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at:
          http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>

        <div class="pri-hd">According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</div>

        <p>Users can visit our site anonymously<br>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our
          homepage, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.
          Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.
        </p>

        <p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:<br>• On our Privacy Policy Page</p>

        <p>Users are able to change their personal information:<br>• By logging in to their account</p>

        <div class="pri-hd">How does our site handle do not track signals?</div>

        <p>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT)
          browser mechanism is in place.</p>

        <div class="pri-hd">Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</div>

        <p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking.</p>

        <div class="pri-hd">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</div>

        <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy
          Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection
          agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to
          protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>

        <div class="pri-hd">Fair Information Practices</div>

        <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the
          concepts
          they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
          Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to
          comply
          with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

        <div class="pri-hd">In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive
          action, should a
          data breach occur:
        </div>

        <p>We will notify the users via email:<br>• Within 7 business days</p>

        <p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue
          legally
          enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle
          requires
          not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse
          to
          courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

        <div class="pri-hd">CAN SPAM Act</div>

        <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial
          messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough
          penalties for violations.</p>

        <div class="pri-hd">We collect your email address in order to:</div>

        <p>• Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</p>
